    <h1>The Rivers</h1>
    <h3>Rivers are a gift of nature. They provide us with fresh water to drink, help us grow food, and support life all
        around.
        Many towns and cities are built near rivers because they make life easier and better.
        <br>
        Rivers are also home to many fish, birds, and plants. They help us in farming, transport, and even in making
        electricity.
        <br>
        But sadly, many rivers today are polluted. Waste, plastic, and chemicals are making them dirty and dangerous. We
        must
        take care of our rivers, not only for ourselves but for future generations too.
        <br>
        Let's keep our rivers clean and flowing. Because a river is not just water â€” itis life.
